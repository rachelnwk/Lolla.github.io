Chappell Roan's set was actually better than I expected. I came in only knowing her most popular song, the one that Sabrina Carpenter did a cover of, but the entire T-Mobile stage was filled up. The most shocking thing that happened was during "Hot To Go", a song I've never heard of, had a dance that everyone somehow knew. You basically had to spell out the letters H-O-T-T-O-G-O, which was basically like a modern YMCA dance.

Favorite Song: Good Luck Babe! (literally the only one i knew)
