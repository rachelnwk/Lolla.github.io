I was actually pleasantly surprised by Megan Thee Stallion's set. It was really hype! I don't listen to her, but she really be putting her ass all up on the screen for us to see. I thought it was actually hilarious when she started talking about how she was at that Democratic rally with Kamala Harris, and told the crowd "Hot Girls for Harris".

Favorite Song: B.A.S (just because it's a popular Tiktok audio)
