I LOVE FAYE WEBSTER. Too bad the friends I went with didn't. It was pretty unfortunate that Faye and Laufey were back to back, because my friends wanted to ditch Faye to get closer for Laufey, when I personally think that Faye Webster is the better artist. I only got to hear a few songs, but it was still worth it.

Favorite song: A Dream with a Baseball Player
