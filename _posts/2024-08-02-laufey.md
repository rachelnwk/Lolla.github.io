Not gonna lie, I don't listen to Laufey that often, I just know her most popular songs. However, when she did sing them, I'll admit it was pretty awesome. It was crazy to me how respectful Laufey fans are in the crowd. Everyone was standing with a foot of space between each other, so it was really calm. The thing is, Laufey's songs are sung in a lower pitch, so really you couldn't hear anyone singing in the crowd because everyone's quieter at a lower pitch (I think).

Favorite Song: Promise
