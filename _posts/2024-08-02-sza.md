I missed her whole set basically because of how entranced I was at Zedd, so I can't say that I have very much of an opinion of the SZA set. I heard a few popular songs, and then my friend wanted to go, but I'm sure it was great. I heard Snooze and Kill Bill, and that was basically it.

Favorite Song: Snooze (wasn't very much for me to choose from lol)
