Favorite set of the weekend, no debate. I was only planning on staying for Zedd for fifteen minutes with my friend, as there was some downtime before SZA started, but then we ended up basically staying at Zedd the entire time. The lighting effects were good but not to the point where you just can't see, and the songs were oldies but goodies. Beautiful set. I would honestly go back next year just to see him again.

Favorite Song: I Want You To Know w/ Selena Gomez
