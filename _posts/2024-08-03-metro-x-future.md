Holy MID. THey started thirty minutes late, yet ended on time, so we were just snubbed out of the concert basically. He also played some songs like three times, which made literally no sense to me at all since we were already behind on time. Moshing with grown men is also never a good idea, but it was actually so funny getting thrashed around whenever the beat drop. It felt like I was literally in a roller coaster.

Favorite Song: Low Life
