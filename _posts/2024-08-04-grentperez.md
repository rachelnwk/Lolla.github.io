I'm not going to lie, I have quite literally never heard of a grentperez song until that day. He is quite popular in the Asian community, but I never gave him a chance. We got to barricade, and I was actually really impressed by his set. He has great songs, and he is a really good performer and gets the crowd going. He played a lot of unrealeased songs for us too (not like I even knew any of the released ones). My friend said his drummer was hot, but I beg to differ.

Favorite Song: When the Day is Done
