Not going to lie, I only saw Vince Staples because we had nothing to do, and I used to listen to him way back when. I was just waiting the whole time for him to play something that I knew, but I literally knew none of the songs he was playing, so me and my friend just made Tiktoks in the meantime. He played one song I knew at the very end, so I'll take it.

Favorite Song: Big Fish
