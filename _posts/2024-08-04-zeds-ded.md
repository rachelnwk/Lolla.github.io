Zedd made me want to go to a rave, and Zeds Dead made me NOT want to ever go to a rave. I was quite literally being blinded, and I clsoed my eyes whenever the crazy lights would come on. It was actually so hard to see anything. The instrumentals were also just not my cup of tea, and neither were the graphics. They were giving old-timey.

Favorite Song: I literally don't have one, everything was a blur
